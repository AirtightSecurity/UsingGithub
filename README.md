# UsingGithub
This project is a test project so students can fork the repository, make an update and submit a pull request.

### The basics

## What is a fork?

Fork a project means when you find a porject that is not yours and you want to contribute to it (propose changes) you can fork that project into your GitHub account.

## Make changes to the project

Once the project has been forked into your GitHub account you can make the desired changes.

## Submit a pull request

Once you are happy with the changes you have made to the project you then submit a pull request back to the project owner.


Instructions on how to fork, update and submit a pull request can be found [here](https://github.com/AirtightSecurity/UsingGithub/blob/216a68f7f8f32e0581f5fb02f0cbafe8652583ff/exercise-1.md) (work in progress).
